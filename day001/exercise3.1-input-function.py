# Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name.
# You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.
# e.g. If the user inputs "Angela", the output should be 6.

# Printing the number of characters of a name
# This is a simplified version

name = input("What's your name? ")
length = len(name)
print(length)
